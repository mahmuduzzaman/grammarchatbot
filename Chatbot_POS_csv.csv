relative clause;sentence;How to form a sentence with a relative clause?;A defining or identifying clause tells us which specific person or thing we are talking about in a larger group of people or things.

A non-defining or non-essential clause gives us more information about the person or thing we are talking about. If a non-defining relative clause is removed from a sentence, we lose some detail, but the overall meaning of the sentence remains the same. Non-defining relative clauses are always set off from the rest of the sentence with commas or parentheses.;The woman who visited me in the hospital was very kind.
